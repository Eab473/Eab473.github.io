<h2>Participants</h2>

<p>Cassie Miller is one of my colleagues and also teaches second grade.  We've previously discussed many times how it would be nice to have our own classroom webpage.  She liked that the students and parents each had their own page.  Cassie looked at my website on her MacBook Air 13.  She was on our schools website and said everything loaded fine.</p>
<p>One of my students whom name I can't share but we'll call her Jill Skill.  Jill looked at my website on one of our school ipads.  She said it will be nice to have a webpage with just our classes information.  She said she is excited to see the table with all the games, etc and she said liked how she could locate her grades and her accelerated reader login information and could easily see how many tests she'd taken etc.  Jill was using one of my classroom ipads. Everything loaded up fine on it and she was connect to our schools internet.</p>
 <p>Brianna Perkins is a parent of one of my students.  She's very excited to see how the website finally turns out.  She likes the idea that everything will be accessible, school newsletter, lunch menu, grades and many other things.  She mentioned that I should put some pictures of the students in my class or even my classroom.  She's excited to see the end webpage, she thinks it has lots of potential.  She was on a Toshiba 13 inch laptop.  She was on her home internet and she said everything appeared well.</p>

 <p>After reviewing the results from evaluators. They all menitoned that the webpage uploaded fine. They mentioned they could easily locate the page they wanted to access.  It was mentioned that they like to colors I choose.  These are actually the colors of my classroom and they liked that idea.</p>
<p> Jill mentioned she was excited to see what informaton I would be including on my webpage.  She's excited to see the games that are one there. Cassie mentioned the same thing with the content on the page; she mentioned in conversation how it would be beneficial for her as a teacher to be able to locate useful information. Brianna was also excited to see what the content would be. </p>
<p> They eached used three different devices.  I noticed that on the ipad the footer was at the top.  I'll work on that.  Chrome worked well along with Safari.</p>

<h2><b>Recommended/Planned Changes</b></h2>

<p> Based on the feedback that I have collected, I plan on making the following changes:
 
<p><b>Improving Design</p>

<!--list items -->

<ul>
 <li><b> Images:</b> I plan to add some graphics to make the webpage look better.  I think theres are some aras that need to be filled to make it catch the viewers eyes and want them to come back.</li>
 <li><b> Navigation:</b> I need to look into why on an ipad or even a cell phone that the footer appears in the body and not the bottom of the page.  I will be working on this based on the information I received.</li>
</ul>

 <p><b>Enriching Content</p>

<!--list items -->

<ul>
 <li><b>Parents:</b> I will be creating a table to include some links to some useful sites for parents. I'll be adding some pictures as well.</li>
 <li><b>Students:</b> I will be creating a table to include links for students to access.  I will be adding more graphics for them so its more appealing to them.</li>
 <li><b>Teacher:</b> I will be creating a table to have some useful sites for other teachers.</li>
 <li><b>About Me:</b> I will be creating this page to include a picture of me and possiblity my classroom.</li>
</ul>
 
  
 
  
  <p><b>Reflections on the Evaluation Process</b></p>
  <p> Having the evaluation process was interesting to me.  I got alot of verbal feedback.  They gave me suggestions that would help my webpage.  It was interesting to see the different things that they suggest I include in my content were very similar to the things I was planning to include.  i will be taking their advice and adding those changes.  I always like hearing feedback whether positive or negative.  This feeback will help me finalize my webpage.</p>
 <P> I will be making the suggested changes they recommended.  They like the ideas of using a table to provide links so it looks better. </p>
